# Mindful Moments 

Welcome to my Mindful moments website. The mission of this webapge is to provide resources, support, and information to help individuals understand and improve their mental health. Included are various related topics, a call to action, a form and a professional interview. I choose to do these things as it covers diffrent point of views of mental health  with the intension of helping a wide range of audiences. 

Due to some complicated problems I had during the assignment, I was unable to submit and present with the rest of the class. I was aware that it was importatnt that i didnt push or commit any more work on that repo. So this is my resubbmisson for project 1.

## User stories 

I used Ai to generate my user stories and then processed them into a project board on Github. I approached copilot with varied prompts to ensure I could refine my results.

## Validation

I tested my page using W3C and NU html checker. One thing that I would do differently in future projects is valid early on. so you are constantly checking and then it doesnt build up. My CSS contained no errors, however my HTML contained around 8. I didnt not have time to sort these as I checked vailidity too late.

## Technology used

I used a combination of HTML, CSS and the bootstrap library. I also used mircosoft copilot for content and some structure.
